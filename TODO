LATER:
 - Design data-file persistency standard
 
TODO:
 - Change DGW3 to make it work on actual and target timespans
 	- Update nlgnet to conformal's btcnet and implement all values
 	- Get BigNum calculations in algorithms
 	- Do bits to diff (decimal human representation) calculation
 - Implement simulator based on timed join/leave of larger miners (not multipool)
 - Implement multipool simulation (based on diff)


DONE:
 - Implement simple wave hashrate simulation
 - Setup flags and cli commandline
 - Design algorithm interface
 - Design simulation interface
 - Change dgw3 so it's compatible with algorithm interface
